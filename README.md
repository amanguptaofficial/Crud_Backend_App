- **Database Integration:** MySQL database is used to store and manage data, and Spring Data JPA is employed to interact with the database.
- **CRUD Operations:** Endpoints are created to handle CRUD operations, enabling users to create, read, update, and delete data in the database.


## Workflow Overview:
1. **Back End Development:** RESTful APIs are designed and implemented using Java with Spring Boot. Spring Data JPA is used to interact with the MySQL database.
2. **Integration:** Front end and back end are integrated using APIs created in Postman, ensuring smooth communication between the two layers.
3. **Testing and Deployment:** The application is thoroughly tested to ensure functionality and reliability before deployment to production environment.
